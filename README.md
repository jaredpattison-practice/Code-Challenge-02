Challenges
Check out a new branch in your code-challenges repository.
Make a new directory in the root of your repo named "value-vs-reference".
Create a file in this new directory named challenges-02.test.js.
Copy and paste the entire content of today's code challenge{:target="_blank"} into the new file.
Run jest challenges-02.test.js to execute the tests in the file.
Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.
Submission
When you have completed the entire set of code challenges and all tests pass, create a pull request from your current branch to the master branch. Don't merge it yet.

Submit a link to your pull request.

After your assignment has been graded, go ahead and merge your pull request, and delete your branch.
